## üöÄ About The Project

TRASH-CLASH was created to solve a common problem for Clash of Clans players: finding up-to-date, effective, and well-organized base layouts and attack strategies. Unlike static guide websites, this platform provides a dynamic and interactive experience where users can filter content by game mode (Town Hall vs. Builder Hall) and type.

The application features a public, read-only view for all users and a secure admin panel for content management, all powered by a robust RESTful API.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dynamic Content Filtering:** Users can instantly filter troops, layouts, and strategies by game mode and type.
- **Interactive UI:** A responsive and modern user interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Image Carousels:** Base layout cards feature auto-sliding image carousels with a pause-on-hover feature to preview multiple base designs.
- **Secure Admin Panel:** A JWT-based authentication system protects CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all content.
- **Pagination:** Efficiently handles large sets of data by paginating layout and strategy lists.
- **Detailed View Pages:** Clicking on a layout takes the user to a dedicated page with a larger image carousel, detailed description, and a "Use This Layout" link.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated deployments for both frontend and backend ensure seamless updates.

| Category           | Technology                               |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend** | React, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a classic client-server model:

-   **Frontend (Client):** A Single Page Application (SPA) built with **React**. It communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls to fetch and display data.
-   **Backend (Server):** A **Node.js/Express.js** server that handles business logic, interacts with the database, and exposes a set of API endpoints.
-   **Database:** A **PostgreSQL** database hosted on Render stores all application data, including users, troops, layouts, and strategies.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18.x or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   PostgreSQL installed locally

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Frontend & Backend Repositories**
    ```sh
    # Clone the frontend
    git clone [https://github.com/NagaSaiRam89/TrashClash_server](https://github.com/NagaSaiRam89/TrashClash)
    cd trash-clash-frontend
    npm install

    # Clone the backend
    git clone [https://github.com/NagaSaiRam89/TrashClash_server](https://github.com/NagaSaiRam89/TrashClash_server)
    cd trash-clash-backend
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    ```sh
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your **backend** directory and add the following:
    env
    PORT=5000
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_DB_USER:YOUR_DB_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/trashclash"
    JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY"
    
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your **frontend** directory:
    env
    VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:5000/api"
    ```

3.  **Set Up the PostgreSQL Database**
    -   Create a new database named `trashclash`.
    -   Run the SQL scripts located in the `/db` folder of the backend to create the necessary tables (`troops`, `layouts`, `strategies`).

4.  **Run the Application**
    ```sh
    # Run the backend server
    cd trash-clash-backend
    npm start

    # Run the frontend development server
    cd trash-clash-frontend
    npm start
    ```

## üåê Deployment

This project is deployed using a modern CI/CD pipeline:

-   The **React frontend** is deployed on **Vercel**, which is connected directly to the `main` branch of the frontend GitHub repository. Every push triggers an automatic build and deployment.
-   The **Node.js backend** and **PostgreSQL database** are hosted on **Render**. The backend service is also connected to its GitHub repository and redeploys automatically on every push to the `main` branch.
